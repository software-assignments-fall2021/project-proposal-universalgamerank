# Project Proposal

Project Title: Universal Game Cooperative (UGC)

What and why?

The original idea for this project stemmed from my interest in client-authoritative server architecture found in codebases such as Quake 3: Arena and Half-Life 2. I intended to replicate this paradigm in JS (a language I am somewhat familiar with). However, I quickly learned that this class is more geared towards web development. With a bit of additional thinking, I had the idea of creating a universal game development platform to allow users to share workflows, algorithms, and tricks to help others learn about the process. Unlike networks such as itch.io, this platform will house tutorials on game mechanics, rendering techniques, level development, and many more solutions that arise when creating games. For context, I originally came up with this idea during my freshmen year here at NYU. However, now seems like the perfect time to introduce and potentially flesh it out.I know from personal experience that game development is incredibly difficult and sometimes tedious (software in general is like this). This is especially the case if one is by themselves and doesn't have the resources that a studio may have. 

For whom?

Ultimately, this platform seeks to serve passionate, aspiring game developers that cannot afford higher education, or desire to go their own way. This platform does not attempt to undermine seasoned developers or neglect inexperienced hobbyists. In particular, this forum will house content for anybody to post, view, and share. Evidently, UGC seeks to be as hands off as possible while providing knowledge to anybody who wants to learn about game development for free.

How?

Tutorials can be posted by anyone, and can target anybody. As well as this, tutorials that are deemed especially helpful or interesting will be selected and highlighted for users browsing the service. Posts are ranked by other users on their accessibility, depth, and trust-worthiness. Posts can range from several forms of media such as videos, game demos, articles, and even links to external websites if a user may choose to include them. 

Scope

This project is fairly simple as it resembles the concept of an ideal, unmonitored forum space such as Newgrounds, 4chan, etc. The only difficulty that I can possibly foresee is managing user information in a database such as MongoDB.
